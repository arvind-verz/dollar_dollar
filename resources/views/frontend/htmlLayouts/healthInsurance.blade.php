            <h4>Health Insurance has become a need, not an option to have</h4>
            <p>With rising healthcare costs and an aging population, having a basic health insurance is crucial. Not only does it help to ease your financial burden during times of medical need, but it also provides one with a peace of mind should any unforeseen health issues occur.</p>
            <p>Having to deal with a major illness is already stressful. Coupled with the need to think about how to settle the medical bills will definitely cause more distress to you and your family.</p>
            <p><strong>What does Health Insurance cover</strong></p>
            <p>Health insurance covers either partial or full medical expenses incurred as a result of sickness or injury. It includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismemberment.</p>
